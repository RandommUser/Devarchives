Old Guild Wars 2 developer comment archives

This is my project to make all the developer comments from the original Guild Wars 2 forums viewable, searchable and being able to find them with old permalinks.

The .json database is free to use as well as the python code that was used to pull the data. The original code was done by /u/shinitakunai from Reddit and modified by me to pull the data in a way I wanted along with changing it's starting point to be more easily controlled.
